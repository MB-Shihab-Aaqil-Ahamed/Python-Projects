# Quadratic Equation Solver

This is a Python program that computes the roots of a quadratic equation given integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

## Usage

To use this program, simply run it in a Python environment and enter values for `a`, `b`, and `c` when prompted. The program will then calculate the roots of the quadratic equation and print them to the console.

For example, if you enter `a=1`, `b=5`, and `c=6`, the program will output:

Enter a: 1
Enter b: 5
Enter c: 6
Roots are: -3.0 -2.0
