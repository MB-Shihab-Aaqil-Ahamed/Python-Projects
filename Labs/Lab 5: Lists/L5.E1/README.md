# Exercise L5.E1

## Problem Description

Develop a program to find and display the minimum and the maximum among 10 numbers separated by white spaces (see the example) entered from the keyboard. You must use a list to store the numbers entered. The numbers can be negative or non-integers.

## Example

Input:
4 -6 5.2 -3 4 2.4 35 734 9 -35.3

Output:
Minimum = -35.3
Maximum = 734


## Solution

1. Read 10 numbers separated by whitespace from the user input.
2. Convert the input string to a list of numbers.
3. Find the minimum and maximum of the numbers using the `min` and `max` functions.
4. Print the results.
