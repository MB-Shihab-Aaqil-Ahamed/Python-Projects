Program to find the day of the week for a given date

This program reads a date in the format yyyy mm dd and calculates the corresponding day of the week using the formula specified in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determination_of_the_day_of_the_week#Implementation-dependent_methods.

## Input Format

The program expects the input to be three integers separated by a space: yyyy mm dd

## Output Format

The program outputs a single integer, which is the day of the week corresponding to the input date. The integer is in the range 0 to 6, where 0 represents Sunday, 1 represents Monday, and so on.

## Example

Input:

2021 6 24

Output:

4

The program stops after computing the corresponding day of the week and printing it to the console using the format string "Day of the week is: %d", where %d is replaced by the value of f, the computed day of the week.
