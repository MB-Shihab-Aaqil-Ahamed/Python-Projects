# Quadratic Equation Solver

This program computes the roots of a quadratic equation given the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.

## Usage

1. Compile the program by running the command `gcc quadratic.c -o quadratic` in a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the program by typing `./quadratic` in the terminal or command prompt.
3. Enter values for `a`, `b`, and `c` when prompted.
4. The program will compute and print the roots of the quadratic equation.

## Example

Suppose we want to solve the equation `x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0`. We can use this program to find the roots as follows:

$ ./quadratic
Enter a: 1
Enter b: 7
Enter c: 12
Roots are: -4.0 -3.0

This means that the roots of the equation are `-4.0` and `-3.0`.
